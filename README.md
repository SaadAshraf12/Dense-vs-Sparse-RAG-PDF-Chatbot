# Dense-vs-Sparse-RAG-PDF-Chatbot
This project is an interactive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using Streamlit that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content. It implements and compares two retrieval techniques—Dense Retrieval and Sparse Retrieval—to evaluate their answer quality and response time side by side.
